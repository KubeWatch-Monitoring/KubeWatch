# KubeWatch

KubeWatch is (will be) a monitoring application for Kubernetes.
It will keep track of multiple K8S nodes, records performance data and visualize it.
Furthermore, it should send some kind of notification to the responsible people.

## Road map

- [ ] Monitor K8S nodes
- [ ] Collect data from nodes
- [ ] Visualize the data somehow
- [ ] Send notification
- [ ] Run an analysis on the aggregated data
- [ ] Visualize the K8S pods and nodes in a graph
