# Usability Test 23.05.2022

To test our application we planed for the project a usability test. This
test will help us to check the application of intuitivity and self
explanation.

The usability test was performed by Marco Agostini and the results are
documented in this chapter.

## Results

### Dashboard

-   In the charts there is actualy a button which is called \"Delete\".
    To make it clearlier which action is placed behind this button we
    should change the button name to \"Delete Chart\".

-   It is confusing that the charts are shown in \"Bytes\" because it
    does not make a lot of sense to show these data in bytes.

-   In each chart ther is another button callen \"Collapse\" but when
    you click the button and the chart is collapsed the name of the
    button should change to \"Expand\".

-   It will be a lot more manageable when there is another button on
    each chart to change the chart directly without a new creation of
    the chart.

-   There should be auto scaling for the values in the charts.

### List all Pods

-   When the database lost the connection there should somewhere be a
    notification for, actually only a button appear but it will be
    clearer if there is also a text (maybe in red).

-   Often this view shows database unavailable (why?).

-   In the Pod descripter there is *Health* and *State* mixed together,
    because \"Running\" is a *State* the *Health*.

### Cluster Visualization

-   Add a cluster vis zoom into the objects.

-   For better visualization use different colors for different things.

-   It will be a lot more handable if you can click in the cluster
    visualization to get the pod description directly.

### Notification Overview

-   At the bottom of the notification table there is a line which is a
    little bit confusing because at the top of the table is not a line
    too.

### Settings

-   On this side there is often the world \"Settings\". Maybe we can
    change the name a little bit, but it will not confuse that much.

### Edit Dashboard

-   The oldest and newest datapoint description is not that clear, so a
    user will not understand what he needs to enter in this two fields.

-   For better usability it will make sense to integreate the *Edit
    Dashboard* page in the *Dashboard* because when you like to edit a
    chart you search on the chart page (Dashboard) and not in the
    navigation bar for this option.

### General

-   Make a clear navigation bar to separate them a little bit form the
    content of the page.

-   The page headers are not always in the same size.
