\chapter{Time Tracking Report}

\instructions{
    \section{How we track time}
    We record and plan all our tasks with individual issues on Gitlab.
    For every task we estimate how much time it's going to take and every team member reports his time spent on that task.
    The estimated and spent times are tracked with an accuracy of 15min.

    \section{Time tracking statistics}
    8 hours count as 1 day in this context.
