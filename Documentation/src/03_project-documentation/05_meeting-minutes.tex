As we run two meetings per week, there are two folder, one for the internal meeting\footnote{\url{https://gitlab.ost.ch/SEProj/2022-FS/g03-kubewatch/kubewatch/-/tree/main/Documentation/meeting-notes-intern}}
and one for the meeting with our advisor\footnote{\url{https://gitlab.ost.ch/SEProj/2022-FS/g03-kubewatch/kubewatch/-/tree/main/Documentation/meeting-notes-advisor}}.
