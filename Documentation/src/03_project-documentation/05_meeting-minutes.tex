The meeting minutes can be found in our repository. The role of a meeting chair is assigned to a team member for the whole week. This person creates the agenda, runs the meeting and is responsible for creating the meeting minutes. \newline

As we run two meetings per week, there are two folders, one for the internal meeting\footnote{\url{https://gitlab.ost.ch/SEProj/2022-FS/g03-kubewatch/kubewatch/-/tree/main/Documentation/meeting-notes-intern}}
and one for the meeting with our advisor\footnote{\url{https://gitlab.ost.ch/SEProj/2022-FS/g03-kubewatch/kubewatch/-/tree/main/Documentation/meeting-notes-advisor}}.
