\chapter{Project Plan}

\instructions{
    Describe the project plan as covered in the SEP2 module. A project plan typically consists of the following topics:
    
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Processes, meetings and roles
        \item Phases, iterations and milestones
        \item A \textbf{rough} list of things to be done (work items)
        \item Risk management
        \item Planning Tools (issue tracker, time tracker, ...)
    \end{itemize}
    
    You should \textbf{\underline{not}} describe your \textbf{technical solution} in this chapter. It is all about organizing your project.
