\textbf{KubeWatch} is a monitoring web application to monitor Kubernetes clusters. This application is designed for technical users and requires some basic knowledge about Kubernetes. With KubeWatch you can visualise and summarise various metrics of a cluster or individual nodes and different Kubernetes workloads. With an adaptive interface, each user can view the metrics and visualisations according to their own preferences. In addition to visualisation, KubeWatch has an alert function, for which thresholds on different metrics can be set in the web application by individual users. KubeWatch will use these metrics to calculate whether an alert needs to be sent or whether the value is still within the desired range. The are shown/sent via simple pop up notifications, email or other messaging applications. With this feature set, KubeWatch allows for easy monitoring and user-defined alerting.
