\paragraph{KubeWatch} is a monitoring application for Kubernetes (K8S), intended for technical users.
It keeps track of multiple K8S nodes, records performance data over time and generates visualizations from the aggregated data.
It can detect when a node goes down, which triggers a notification to the person in charge.
We chose this topic because it combines multiple technical aspects, so that each team member can get something out of it.
