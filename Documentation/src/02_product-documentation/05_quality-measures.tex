\section{Apply Quality standard}
To provide a certain code standard and quality some coding guidelines were specified.
These guidelines can be found in the section \ref{guidelines-web-api}.
For the Kubernetes similar guidelines were specified.
You can find them in section \ref{guidelines-kubernetes}.


\section{Test Concept}
To provide a software with a good quality we need to test it.
For this project three different types of tests are used:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Unit Tests
  \item Integration Tests
  \item Usability Tests
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Unit Test}
The Unit Tests are done using the \textit{mocha}, \textit{chai}, \textit{chai-http} and \textit{chai-dom} framework.

\subsection{Integration Test}
